The observations are as follows:

1) As size of file increases, db insert time increases.

2) If we change the order of file sizes(large size, smaller file, larger file...), we see that time of insertion is proportional to the size of file

3) We observe that on inserting the same file in a loop 10 times, there is a fair degree of consistency in readings, with one or two anomalies in the readings, due to machine issues.

4) On similar machines like 2 i3 machines, there isnt a radical difference in readings. But an i5 machine produces faster results

5) We cannot insert a file greater than 18MB in one call. If we try to insert a 20MB file, it crashes.
